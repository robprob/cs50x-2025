SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability)
FROM songs;

This returns an average:
    Energy: 0.66
    Valence: 0.48
    Danceability: 0.72

First, the statistical measure used may not be particularly helpful, and others, even median, should be considered.
Second, due to the abstract nature of these descriptors, they are likely more suitably compared against the statistical norms of other users, rather than taking them at face value.
Third, the abstract nature of "audio aura" itself makes it challenging to determine a better calculation. It would be beneficial to explore how the current descriptors for each song are calculated and determine if the process could be improved/more insightful, or use different descriptors altogether to reach the intended goal.
